# identitylib

The goal of this project is to formalize the many identities in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik's Table of Integrals, Series, and Products using the Lean theorem prover.

This will be a massive undertaking, but my current goal is to at least get through the first chapter.

The primary identities will be proven in ```chapter{n}.lean```, while corresponding helper theorems will be proven in ```lemmas{n}.lean```. The identities will be named according to the equation number in the book (currently the 7th edition).
